# continuedfractions

A simple extension of the Python [`fractions`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html) standard library for working with [continued fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction) as Python objects.

[Continued fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction) are beautiful and interesting mathematical objects, with many connections in [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory) and also very useful practical applications, including the [rational approximation of real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction#Best_rational_approximations).

The `continuedfractions` package is designed to:

* make it easy to construct (finite) continued fractions as Python objects
* explore their key properties, such as elements/coefficients, convergents, segments, remainders, and others
* operate on them as rationals and instances of the standard library [`fractions.Fraction`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html#fractions.Fraction) class
