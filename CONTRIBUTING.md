# Contributing

The project homepage is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions).

Contributors and contributions are welcome via pull requests from a fork
targeting the parent `main`
[branch](https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/tree/main).

A simple Git workflow, using a feature and/or fix branch created off the
`main` branch of your fork, is recommended.

## Cloning

If you wish to contribute please first ensure you have [SSH access to
GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).
If you do then this should work:

``` bash
ssh -vT git@github.com
```

If not please follow the SSH instructions linked above.

Once youâ€™ve forked the repository, you can clone your fork, e.g. over
SSH:

``` python
git clone git+ssh://git@github.com/<fork user>/continuedfractions
```

You can create additional remotes for the parent project to enable
easier syncing, or you can simply create PRs directly against the parent
project.

## Dependencies & PDM

The package has no external (production) dependencies - some development
dependencies are specified in the `[tool.pdm.dev-dependencies]` section
of the [project
TOML](https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/blob/main/pyproject.toml),
but they are not mandatory. Of these, the most important are probably
the `'test'` dependencies, including
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.0.x/) and
[pytest-cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/):

``` toml
test = [
    "coverage[toml]",
    "pytest",
    "pytest-cov",
    "pytest-xdist",
]
```

[PDM](https://pdm-project.org/latest) is used (by myself, currently, the
sole maintainer) to manage all dependencies and publish packages to
PyPI. It is also used to automate certain tasks, such as running tests,
as described in the section.

There are no root-level `requirements*.txt` files - but only a single
(default, version-controlled, cross-platform)
[pdm.lock](https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/blob/main/pdm.lock)
lockfile, which defines metadata for all TOML-defined development
dependencies, including the currently empty set of production
dependencies, and their sub-dependencies etc. This can be used to
install all development dependencies, including the project itself, in
editable mode where available:

``` bash
pdm install -v --dev
```

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to note that the `pdm install` uses either the default
> `pdm.lock` lockfile, or one specified with `-L <lockfile>`. Multiple
> lockfiles can be generated and maintained. Refer to the [PDM install
> documentation](https://pdm-project.org/latest/reference/cli/#install)
> for more information.

If you don't wish to install any editable dependencies, including the
project itself, you can use:

``` bash
pdm install -v --dev --no-editable --no-self
```

The default lockfile can be updated with any and all upstream changes in
the TOML-defined dependencies, but excluding any editable dependencies
including the project itself, using:

``` bash
pdm update -v --dev --no-editable --no-self --update-all
```

This will usually modify `pdm.lock`, in which case the file should be
staged and included in a commit.

The lockfile can be exported in its entirety to another format, such as
`docs/requirements.txt` using:

``` bash
pdm export -v -f requirements --dev -o docs/requirements.txt
```

For more information on PDM lockfiles and installing requirements see
the [PDM documentation](https://pdm-project.org/latest/).

## Makefile and Tests

The [Makefile](Makefile) defines three main targets: `lint` for Ruff
linting, `doctests` for running
[doctests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html) and
`unittests` for running unittests and measuring coverage, using `pytest`
and the `pytest-cov` plugin:

``` bash
make lint
make doctests
make unittests
```

Linting warnings should be addressed first. The doctests serve as
acceptance tests, and are best run after the unit tests.

## Documentation

[Project
documentation](https://continuedfractions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is
defined and built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/),
and deployed to [Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org). Currently, the
building and deployment steps for documentation are not automated in a
CI pipeline, but are done manually - this will be addressed in future
releases.

The Sphinx documentation can be built locally on any branch from the
**project root** using:

``` bash
make -C docs "html"
```

First, ensure that you have installed the docs Python requirements,
which include all development dependencies, either via `pip`:

``` bash
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

or via [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/):

``` bash
pdm install -v --dev --no-editable --no-self
```

## Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

The CI/CD pipelines are defined in the [CI
YML](.github/workflows/ci.yml), and pipelines for all branches include a
tests stage, consisting of Ruff linting, Python doctests, and unit
tests, in that order. This will be amended in the future to ensure that
tests are only run on updates to PRs targeting `main`, to avoid
duplication on `main`.

## Versioning and Releases

The [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/continuedfractions/) is
currently at version `0.12.7` - the goal is to use [semantic
versioning](https://semver.org/) consistently for all future releases,
but some earlier releases do not comply with strict semantic versioning.

There is currently no dedicated pipeline for releases - both [GitHub
releases](https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/releases) and
[PyPI packages](https://pypi.org/project/continuedfractions) are
published manually, but both have the same version tag.

Pipelines for releases will be added as part of a future release.
