# continuedfractions

A simple extension of the Python [`fractions`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html) standard library for working with [continued fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction) as Python objects.[^1]

## Installation & Dependencies

The package does not use any 3rd party (production) dependencies, only Python standard libraries, and is supported on Python versions `3.10`-`3.12`. It is CI-tested on Ubuntu Linux (22.04.3 LTS), Mac OS (12.7.3) and Windows (Windows Server 2022), but should also install on any other platform supporting these Python versions.

The simplest way of installing it is a standard `pip`/`pip3` install:

```python
pip install continuedfractions
```

For contributors there are development requirements which are specified in the [project TOML](https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/blob/main/pyproject.toml) - contribution guidelines are described in more detail later.

## Working with Continued Fractions

[Continued fractions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction) are beautiful and interesting mathematical objects, with many connections in [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory) and also very useful practical applications, including the [rational approximation of real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction#Best_rational_approximations).

The `continuedfractions` package is designed to make it easy to construct (finite) continued fractions as Python objects, and explore their key properties, such as elements/coefficients, convergents, segments, remainders, and others. They have been implemented as instances of the standard library [`fractions.Fraction`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html#fractions.Fraction) class, of which they are automatically instances, and are thus fully operable as rational numbers.

### Package Structure

The `continuedfractions` package consists of two libraries:

* [`continuedfractions.lib`](https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/blob/main/src/continuedfractions/lib.py) - this contains the core functionality of (1) generating continued fraction representations (as ordered element sequences) of any valid Python number, given as an integer, non-nan `float`, valid numeric string, a `fractions.Fraction` or `decimal.Decimal` object, or as a pair of integers and/or `fractions.Fraction` objects; and conversely (2) reconstructing rational fractions from continued fraction representations (again, given as ordered element sequences).

* [`continuedfractions.continuedfraction`](https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/blob/main/src/continuedfractions/continuedfraction.py) - this contains the main `ContinuedFraction` class, which subclasses `fractions.Fraction`. The `ContinuedFraction` objects encapsulate a number of key properties, such as the sequences of their elements and convergents, and provide other utility methods.

The functions in `continuedfractions.lib` are standalone and thus useful on their own, but it is easiest to work with objects created from the `continuedfraction.ContinuedFraction` class.

### A Simple Introduction with Examples

From a user perspective it is easiest to use the [`continuedfractions.continuedfraction.ContinuedFraction`](https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/blob/main/src/continuedfraction.py) class. A simple introduction is given below with a variety of examples.

#### Importing the `ContinuedFraction` Class

Import the core class from `continuedfractions.continuedfraction`.

```python
>>> from continuedfractions.continuedfraction import ContinuedFraction
```

#### Creating Continued Fractions from Numbers

We can take a simple rational number[^2] $\frac{649}{200} = \frac{3 \times 200 + 49}{200} = 3.245$, which has the following finite continued fraction representation:

$$
\frac{649}{200} = 3 + \frac{1}{4 + \frac{1}{12 + \frac{1}{4}}}
$$

This representation is called **simple** because all of the numerators in the fractional terms are equal to $1$, which makes the fractions irreducible. Mathematically, the continued fraction is written as $[3; 4, 12, 4]$.

The continued fraction object for $\frac{649}{200}$ can be created as follows.

```python
>>> cf = ContinuedFraction(649, 200)
>>> cf
ContinuedFraction(649, 200)
```

**Note**: The same object can also be constructed using `ContinuedFraction('649/200')`, `ContinuedFraction('3.245')`, `ContinuedFraction(Fraction(649, 200))`, `ContinuedFraction(Fraction(649), 200))`, `ContinuedFraction(649, Fraction(200)))`, and `ContinuedFraction(Decimal('3.245'))`. But passing a numeric literal such as `649/200` will result in an evaluation of the decimal integer division using [binary floating point division](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html), thus producing a fractional approximation, in this case, `ContinuedFraction(3653545197704315, 1125899906842624)`.

The float value of `ContinuedFraction(649, 200)` is available via the `.as_float()` method, in this case, an exact value of $3.245$.

```python
>>> cf.as_float()
3.245
```
**Note**: the `.as_float()` is unique to `ContinuedFraction` - it is not defined in the superclass, `fractions.Fraction`.

It is known that every finite continued fraction represents a rational number, and conversely that every rational number can be represented as a finite continued fraction. On the other infinite continued fractions represent irrationals, which cannot therefore be represented exactly as binary fractions. Thus, `ContinuedFraction` objects for irrational numbers will always have a finite sequence of elements, whose length is determined by the smallest binary fraction that can be represented on the given platform. For example $\sqrt{2}$, which is given by a periodic continued fraction $[1; 2, 2, 2, \ldots]$, we have:

```python
>>> sqrt2 = ContinuedFraction(math.sqrt(2))
>>> sqrt2
ContinuedFraction(6369051672525773, 4503599627370496)
>>> sqrt2.as_float()
1.4142135623730951
```

and the fractional part of the float value displayed above is an [approximation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html) based on the most precise binary fractional representation possible on the system. So `ContinuedFraction(x)` for irrational numbers $x$ will only be approximate, not exact.

### Inspecting Properties

A number of key properties of (finite) continued fractions can be explored using `ContinuedFraction`, as described below.

#### Elements and Orders

The **elements** (or coefficients) of a (possibly infinite) continued fraction $[a_0;a_1,a_2\cdots]$  of a real number $x$ include the leading integer $a_0 = \lfloor x \rfloor$ (largest integer part of $x$), and the whole numbers $a_1,a_2,\cdots$ in the denominators of the fractional terms. For `ContinuedFraction` objects the `.elements` property can be used to look at their elements, e.g. for `ContinuedFraction(649, 200)` we have:
```python
>>> cf = ContinuedFraction(649, 200)
>>> cf.elements
(3, 4, 12, 4)
```

The **order** of a continued fraction is defined to be number of its elements **after** the first. Thus, for `ContinuedFraction(649, 200)` the order is `3`:

```python
>>> cf.order
3
```

#### Convergents and Rational Approximations

For an integer $k >= 0$ the $k$-th **convergent** $C_k$ of a continued fraction $[a_0; a_1,\ldots]$ of a real number $x$ is defined to be the rational number and finite continued fraction represented by $[a_0; a_1,\ldots,a_k]$, formed from the first $k + 1$ elements of the original.

$$
C_k = a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1 + \frac{1}{\ddots \frac{1}{a_{k-1} + \frac{1}{a_k}}}}
$$

Each convergent $C_k$ represents a rational approximation $\frac{p_k}{q_k}$ of $x$, and we can define an error term $\epsilon_k = x - C_k = x - \frac{p_k}{q_k}$. If we assume $x > 0$ then the convergents form a strictly increasing sequence of rational numbers, bounded by, and thus converging to, $x$, as $n \longrightarrow \infty$.[^3] So, formally:

$$
\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1} < \cdots \frac{p_n}{q_n} < \cdots \leq x
$$

where the equality on the right holds if and only if $x$ is rational. If $x$ is irrational then we have the limit:

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{p_n}{q_n} = x
$$

This is equivalent to the limit $\lim_{n \to \infty} \epsilon_n = 0$.

The `ContinuedFraction` class provides a `.convergents` property for objects, which returns an immutable map ([`types.MappingProxyType`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.MappingProxyType)) of all $k$-order convergents, indexed (keyed) by integers $k=0,1,\ldots,n$, where $n$ is the order of the continued fraction.

```python
>>> cf.convergents
mappingproxy({0: Fraction(3, 1), 1: Fraction(13, 4), 2: Fraction(159, 49), 3: Fraction(649, 200)})
>>> cf.convergents[2]
Fraction(159, 49)
>>> import operator
>>> # Get the float value of this fraction
>>> operator.truediv(*cf.convergents[2].as_integer_ratio())
3.2448979591836733
```

Obviously, we can only handle finite continued fractions in Python, so the convergents produced by `ContinuedFraction` will be finite in number, regardless of whether the real numbers they approximate are rational or irrational. We can verify that $C_0 < C_1 < \cdots < C_n$ for `ContinuedFraction(649, 200)` and also `ContinuedFraction(math.pi)`:

```python
>>> assert cf.convergents[0] < cf.convergents[1] < cf.convergents[2] < cf.convergents[3] == cf
# True
>>> pi_cf = ContinuedFraction(math.pi)
>>> pi_cf.convergents
mappingproxy({0: Fraction(3, 1), 1: Fraction(22, 7), 2: Fraction(333, 106), 3: Fraction(355, 113), ... , 27: Fraction(3141592653589793, 1000000000000000)})
>>> assert pi_cf.convergents[27] < math.pi
# True
```

**Note**: As the convergents are constructed during `ContinuedFraction` object initialisation, the objects that represent them cannot be of type `ContinuedFraction`, due to recursion errors. Thus, it was decided to keep them as `fractions.Fraction` objects.

#### Segments and Remainders

Convergents are linked to the concept of **segments**, which are finite subsequences of elements of a given continued fraction. More precisely, we can define the $k$-th segment of a continued fraction represented by $[a_0; a_1,\ldots]$ as the sequence of its first $k + 1$ elements, namely $a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_k$, which uniquely determines the $k$-order convergent of the continued fraction. The segments of `ContinuedFraction` objects can be obtained via the `.segment()` method, which takes a non-negative integer not exceeding the order.

```python
>>> cf.segment(0), cf.segment(1), cf.segment(2), cf.segment(3)
(ContinuedFraction(3, 1), ContinuedFraction(13, 4), ContinuedFraction(159, 49), ContinuedFraction(649, 200))3
```
**Note**: Unlike the $k$-order convergents the segments are `ContinuedFraction` objects and uniquely represent them as such.

A related concept is that of **remainders** of continued fractions, which are (possibly infinite) subsequences of elements of a given continued fraction, starting a given element. More precisely, we can define the $k$-th remainder of a continued fraction represented by $[a_0; a_1,\ldots]$ as the sequence of elements $a_k,a_{k + 1},\ldots$ starting from the $k$-th element. The remainders of `ContinuedFraction` objects can be obtained via the `.remainder()` method, which takes a non-negative integer not exceeding the order.

```python
>>> cf.remainder(0), cf.remainder(1), cf.remainder(2), cf.remainder(3)
(ContinuedFraction(649, 200), ContinuedFraction(200, 49), ContinuedFraction(49, 4), ContinuedFraction(4, 1))
```

Another feature which the package includes is [mediants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediant_(mathematics)). The mediant of two rational numbers $\frac{a}{b}$ and $\frac{c}{d}$, where $b, d \neq 0$, is given by the fraction:

$$
\frac{a + c}{b + d}
$$

and has the property that:

$$
\frac{a}{b} < \frac{a + c}{b + d} < \frac{c}{d}
$$

assuming $\frac{a}{b} < \frac{c}{d}$ and $cd > 0$.

The `ContinuedFraction` class provides a `.mediant()` method for objects to compute their mediants with a given fraction, which could be another `ContinuedFraction` or `fractions.Fraction` object. The result is also a `ContinuedFraction` object. A few examples are given below.


```python
>>> ContinuedFraction('0.5').mediant(Fraction(2, 3))
>>> ContinuedFraction(3, 5)
>>> ContinuedFraction(1, 2).mediant(ContinuedFraction('2/3'))
>>> ContinuedFraction(3, 5)
>>> assert ContinuedFraction(1, 2) < ContinuedFraction(1, 2).mediant(Fraction(3, 4)) < ContinuedFraction(3, 4)
# True
````

### Constructing Continued Fractions from Element Sequences

Continued fractions can also be constructed from element sequences, using the `ContinuedFraction.from_elements()` class method. Because `ContinuedFraction` is a subclass of `fractions.Fraction` all `ContinuedFraction` objects are fully operable as rational numbers, including as negative rationals.

```python
>>> cf_inverse = ContinuedFraction.from_elements(0, 3, 4, 12, 4)
>>> cf_inverse
ContinuedFraction(200, 649)
>>> cf_inverse.elements
(0, 3, 4, 12, 4)
>>> assert cf_inverse == 1/cf
# True
>>> assert cf * cf_inverse == 1
# True
>>> cf_negative_inverse = ContinuedFraction.from_elements(-1, 1, 2, 4, 12, 4)
>>> cf_negative_inverse
ContinuedFraction(-200, 649)
>>> cf_negative_inverse.elements
(-1, 1, 2, 4, 12, 4)
>>> assert cf_negative_inverse == -1/cf
# True
>>> assert cf * cf_negative_inverse == -1
>>> assert cf + (-cf) == cf_inverse + cf_negative_inverse == 0
# True
```

### Continued Fractions with Negative Terms

Continued fractions representations with negative terms are valid, provided we use the [Euclidean integer division algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction#Calculating_continued_fraction_representations) to calculate the successive quotients and remainders in each step. For example, $\frac{-415}{93} = \frac{-5 \times 93 + 50}{93}$ has the continued fraction representation $[-5; 1, 1, 6, 7]$. Compare this with $[4; 2, 6, 7]$, which is the continued fraction representation of $\frac{415}{93}$.

`ContinuedFraction` objects for negative numbers are constructed in the same way as with positive numbers, subject to the validation rules described above. And to avoid zero division problems if a fraction has a negative denominator the minus sign is "transferred" to the numerator. A few examples are given below.

```python
>>> ContinuedFraction(415, -93)
ContinuedFraction(-415, 93)
>>> ContinuedFraction(-415, 93)
ContinuedFraction(-415, 93)
>>> -ContinuedFraction(415, 93)
ContinuedFraction(-415, 93)
>>> ContinuedFraction(-415, 93).elements
(-5, 1, 1, 6, 7)
>>> ContinuedFraction(-415, 93).convergents 
mappingproxy({0: Fraction(-5, 1), 1: Fraction(-4, 1), 2: Fraction(-9, 2), 3: Fraction(-58, 13), 4: Fraction(-415, 93)})
>>> ContinuedFraction(-415, 93).as_float()
-4.462365591397849
>>> ContinuedFraction(415, 93).as_float()
4.462365591397849
```

**Note** As negation of numbers is a unary operation, the minus sign in a "negative" `ContinuedFraction` object must be attached to the fraction, before enclosure in parentheses.

```python
>>> -ContinuedFraction(415, 93).elements
...
TypeError: bad operand type for unary -: 'tuple'
>>> -(ContinuedFraction(415, 93)).elements
...
TypeError: bad operand type for unary -: 'tuple'
>>> (-ContinuedFraction(415, 93)).elements
(-5, 1, 1, 6, 7)
>>> assert ContinuedFraction(415, 93) + (-ContinuedFraction(415, 93)) == 0
# True
```

### Input Validation

The `ContinuedFraction` class validates all inputs during object creation - in the `.__new__()` class method, not instance initialisation - using the `.validate()` class method. Inputs that do not meet the following conditions trigger a `ValueError`.

* a single integer or a non-nan float
* a single numeric string
* a single `fractions.Fraction` or `decimal.Decimal` object
* two integers or `fractions.Fraction` objects, or a combination of an integer and a `fractions.Fraction` object, representing the numerator and non-zero denominator of a rational number

A number of examples are given below of validation passes and fails.

```python
>>> ContinuedFraction.validate(100)
>>> ContinuedFraction.validate(3, -2)

>>> ContinuedFraction.validate(1, -2.0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Only single integers, non-nan floats, numeric strings, 
`fractions.Fraction`, or `decimal.Decimal` objects; or two 
integers or two `fractions.Fraction` objects or a pairwise 
combination of these, representing the numerator and non-zero 
denominator, respectively, of a rational fraction, are valid.

>>> ContinuedFraction.validate(-.123456789)
>>> ContinuedFraction.validate('-.123456789')
>>> ContinuedFraction.validate('-649/200')
>>> ContinuedFraction.validate(-3/2)

>>> ContinuedFraction.validate(-3, 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Only single integers, non-nan floats, numeric strings, 
`fractions.Fraction`, or `decimal.Decimal` objects; or two 
integers or two `fractions.Fraction` objects or a pairwise 
combination of these, representing the numerator and non-zero 
denominator, respectively, of a rational fraction, are valid.

>>> ContinuedFraction.validate(Fraction(-415, 93))
>>> ContinuedFraction.validate(Decimal('12345.6789'))
>>> ContinuedFraction.validate(Decimal(12345.6789))

>>> ContinuedFraction.validate(Fraction(3, 2), 2.5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: Only single integers, non-nan floats, numeric strings, 
`fractions.Fraction`, or `decimal.Decimal` objects; or two 
integers or two `fractions.Fraction` objects or a pairwise 
combination of these, representing the numerator and non-zero 
denominator, respectively, of a rational fraction, are valid.

## Contributing

Contributors and contributions are welcome via pull requests from a fork targeting the parent [`main` branch](https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/tree/main). As this is a new and fairly specialised project a simple Git workflow, using a feature and/or fix branch created off the `main` branch of your fork, is recommended.

### SSH and Cloning

If you wish to contribute please first ensure you have [SSH access to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh). If you do then this should work:

```bash
ssh -vT git@github.com
```

If not please follow the SSH instructions linked above. This should include ensuring that your SSH config file defines your SSH private key file, and specifies agent forwarding, and public key authentication as the preferred mode.

Once you've forked the repository, it is recommended to clone your fork over SSH:

```python
git clone git+ssh://git@github.com/<fork user>/continuedfractions
```

### Dependencies & PDM

As mentioned earlier, the package has no (production) dependencies, but groups of development requirements are specified in the `[tool.pdm.dev-dependencies]` section of the [project TOML](pyproject.toml). Of these only the `test` dependencies, including [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.0.x/) and [`pytest-cov`](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/), are important.

```toml
test = [
    "coverage[toml]",
    "pytest",
    "pytest-cov",
    "pytest-xdist",
]
```

[PDM](https://pdm-project.org/latest) is used (by myself, currently, the sole maintainer) to manage all dependencies and publish packages to PyPI. It is also used to automate certain tasks, such as running tests, as described in the section.

There are no `requirements*.txt` files - however, a [PDM lockfile](`pdm.lock`) which defines metadata for all TOML-defined development dependencies, including the currently empty set of production dependencies, and their sub-dependencies etc., can be used to install the project in editable mode.

```bash
pdm install -v
```

For more information on PDM lockfiles and installing requirements see the [PDM documentation](https://pdm-project.org/latest/usage/venv/).

### Makefile and Tests

The [`Makefile`](Makefile) defines three main targets: `lint` for Ruff linting, `doctests` for running [doctests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html) and `unittests` for running unittests and measuring coverage, using `pytest` and the `pytest-cov` plugin:

```bash
make lint
make doctests
make unittests
```

Linting warnings should be addressed first. The doctests serve as acceptance tests, and should be run first, before the unit tests.

### Continous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

The CI/CD pipelines are defined in the [CI YML](.github/workflows/ci.yml), and pipelines for all branches include a tests stage, consisting of Ruff linting, Python doctests, and unit tests, in that order. This will be amended in the future to ensure that tests are only run on updates to PRs targeting `main`, to avoid duplication on `main`.

### Versioning & Package Publishing

The package is currently at version `0.0.4`, and packages are published manually to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/continuedfractions/). There is currently no release pipeline - this will be added later.

For the same reason, the continued fraction representations produced by the package will necessarily be [finite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction#Finite_continued_fractions).

[^2]: The definition of "rational number" used here is standard: a ratio $\frac{a}{b}$ of integers $a$ and $b \neq 0$. If $a$ and $b$ have no common denominator then \frac{a}{b} is irreducible and unique.

[^3]: This is due to the [theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_convergence_theorem) that every bounded monotonic sequence of real numbers converges.
