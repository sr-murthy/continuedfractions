============
Contributing
============

Contributors and contributions are welcome. Please read these guidelines first.

.. _contributing.git:

Git :fab:`github`
=================

The project homepage is on `GitHub <https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions>`_.

Contributors can open pull requests from a fork targeting the parent ``main`` `branch <https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/tree/main>`_. But it may be a good first step to create an `issue <https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/issues>`_ or open a `discussion topic <https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/discussions>`_.

A simple Git workflow, using a feature and/or fix branch created off the ``main`` branch of your fork, is recommended.

.. _contributing.cloning:

Repo :fas:`folder`
==================

If you wish to contribute please first ensure you have `SSH access to GitHub <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh>`_. This basically involves creating a project-specific SSH keypair - if you don't already have one - and adding it to GitHub. If you have done this successfully then this verification step should work:

.. code:: bash

   ssh -vT git@github.com

Some SSH configuration may be required: on MacOS or Linux your user-defined SSH configuration file (:file:`~/.ssh/config`) should look something like this:

.. code:: shell

   Host github.com
     AddKeysToAgent yes
     UseKeychain yes
     ForwardAgent yes
     Preferredauthentications publickey
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<SSH private key filename>
     PasswordAuthentication no

For Windows please consult the `Windows OpenSSH documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_server_configuration>`_.

Once youâ€™ve forked the repository, you can clone your fork, e.g. over SSH:

.. code:: python

   git clone git+ssh://git@github.com/<fork user>/continuedfractions

You can create additional remotes for the parent project to enable easier syncing, or you can simply create PRs directly against the parent project.

.. _contributing.dependencies-and-pdm:

Dependencies & PDM :fas:`cubes`
===============================

The package has no external (production) dependencies - some development dependencies are specified in the
``[tool.pdm.dev-dependencies]`` section of the `project TOML <https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/blob/main/pyproject.toml>`_, but they are not mandatory. Of these, the most important are probably the ``'test'`` dependencies,
including `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.0.x/>`_ and `pytest-cov <https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/>`_:

.. code:: toml

   test = [
       "coverage[toml]",
       "pytest",
       "pytest-cov",
       "pytest-xdist",
   ]

`PDM <https://pdm-project.org/latest>`_ is used (by myself, currently, the sole maintainer) to manage all dependencies and publish packages to PyPI. It is also used to automate certain tasks, such as running tests, as described in the section.

There are no root-level ``requirements*.txt`` files - but only a single (default, version-controlled, cross-platform) `pdm.lock <https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/blob/main/pdm.lock>`_ lockfile, which defines metadata for all TOML-defined development dependencies, including the currently empty set of production dependencies, and their sub-dependencies etc. This can be used to install all development dependencies, including the project itself, in editable mode where available:

.. code:: bash

   pdm install -v --dev

.. note::

   It is important to note that :command:`pdm install` uses either the default lockfile (:file:`pdm.lock`), or one specified with :command:`-L <lockfile>`. Multiple lockfiles can be generated and maintained. Refer to the `PDM install documentation <https://pdm-project.org/latest/reference/cli/#install>`_ for more information.

If you don't wish to install any editable dependencies, including the project itself, you can use:

.. code:: bash

   pdm install -v --dev --no-editable --no-self

The default lockfile can be updated with any and all upstream changes in the TOML-defined dependencies, but excluding any editable dependencies including the project itself, using:

.. code:: bash

   pdm update -v --dev --no-editable --no-self --update-all

This will usually modify :file:`pdm.lock`, in which case the file should be staged and included in a commit.

The lockfile can be exported in its entirety to another format, such as :file:`docs/requirements.txt` using:

.. code:: bash

   pdm export -v -f requirements --dev -o docs/requirements.txt

For more information on PDM lockfiles and installing requirements see the `PDM documentation <https://pdm-project.org/latest/>`_.

.. _contributing.tests:

Tests :fas:`microscope`
=======================

Tests are defined in the :file:`tests` folder, and should be run with `pytest <https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

For convenience different types of test targets are defined in the `Makefile <https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/blob/main/Makefile>`_: ``lint`` for Ruff linting, ``doctests`` for running
`doctests <https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html>`_ and ``unittests`` for running unittests and measuring coverage, using
``pytest`` and the ``pytest-cov`` plugin:

.. code:: bash

   make lint
   make unittests
   make doctests

Linting warnings should be addressed first. The doctests serve as acceptance tests, and are best run after the unit tests.

.. _contributing.documentation:

Documentation :fas:`book`
=========================

`Project documentation <https://continuedfractions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is defined and built using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_, and deployed to `Read The Docs <https://readthedocs.org>`_. Currently, the building and deployment steps for documentation are not automated in a CI pipeline, but are done manually - this will be addressed in future releases.

The Sphinx documentation can be built locally on any branch from the **project root** using:

.. code:: bash

   make -C docs html

First, ensure that you have installed the docs Python requirements, which include all development dependencies, either via :program:`pip`:

.. code:: bash

   pip install -r docs/requirements.txt

or via `PDM <https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/>`_:

.. code:: bash

   pdm install -v --dev --no-editable --no-self

.. _contributing.ci-cd:

CI/CD :fas:`circle-play`
========================

The CI/CD pipelines are defined in the `CI YML <https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml>`_ and the `CodeQL Analysis YML <https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/blob/main/.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml>`_, and pipelines for all branches include a tests stage, consisting of Ruff linting, Python doctests, and unit tests, in that order. This will be amended in the future to ensure that tests are only run on updates to PRs targeting ``main``, to avoid duplication on ``main``.

.. _contributing.versioning-and-releases:

Versioning and Releases :fas:`upload`
=====================================

The `PyPI package <https://pypi.org/project/continuedfractions/>`_ is currently at version ``0.17.3`` - the goal is to use `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ consistently for all future releases, but some earlier releases do not comply with strict semantic versioning.

There is currently no dedicated pipeline for releases - both `GitHub releases <https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/releases>`_ and `PyPI packages <https://pypi.org/project/continuedfractions>`_ are published manually, but both have the same version tag.

Pipelines for releases will be added as part of a future release.
