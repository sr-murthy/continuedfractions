============
Installation
============

A standard :program:`pip` install (with the :code:`-U` "upgrade" option to get the latest version) is sufficient:

.. code:: python

   pip install -U continuedfractions

Only the standard libraries are used. The package is tested and supported on Python 3.12 & 3.13 (on the latest **Ubuntu Linux**, **MacOS**, and **Windows** versions), although it should be fine with Python 3.10-3.11 as well, including with other Linux distributions. Type hinting in some functions and classes uses typing features introduced in 3.10+, so there may be some problems with running this on Python versions 3.9 and below.
