def continued_fraction_rational(r: Fraction, /) -> Generator[int, None, None]:
    """Generates a unique sequence of elements (coefficients) of a (finite, simple) continued fraction of a rational number.

    The resulting sequence of elements defines a continued fraction of the form:

    .. math::

       a_0 + \\cfrac{1}{a_1 + \\cfrac{1}{a_2 + \\ddots\\cfrac{1}{a_{n - 1} + \\cfrac{1}{a_n}}}}

    which is also written more compactly as:

    .. math::

       [a_0; a_1, a_2\\ldots, a_n]

    The order of the continued fraction is said to be :math:`n`. If the last
    element :math:`a_n = 1` the sequence can be rewritten as
    :math:`[a_0; a_1, a_2\\ldots, a_{n - 1} + 1]`, which is then unique as a
    simple continued fraction representation of the rational number.

    Negative rational numbers can also be represented in this way, provided we
    use the `Euclidean division lemma <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_lemma>`_.
    This is described in more detail in the `documentation <https://continuedfractions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sources/creating-continued-fractions.html#negative-continued-fractions>`_.

    For a definition of "continued fraction", "element", "order",
    "finite continued fraction", "simple continued fraction", please consult
    the `package documentation <https://continuedfractions.readthedocs.io/en/stable>`_,
    or any online resource such as `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction>`_,
    or suitable books on number theory.

    Parameters
    ----------
    r : `fractions.Fraction`
        The rational number to represented as a simple continued fraction.

    Yields
    ------
    int
        Elements of a unique simple continued fraction of the given rational
        number.

    Examples
    --------
    A few examples are given below of how this function can be used.

    Notes
    -----
    Every rational number has exactly two simple continued fractions, one of
    which has an additional element of :math:`1` as its last element,
    i.e. :math:`[a_0;a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_{n - 1}, 1]`. But this form can be
    reduced by adding the :math:`1` to the second last element, :math:`a_{n - 1}`,
    producing the shorter form :math:`[a_0;a_1,a_2,\\ldots, a_{n - 1} + 1]`,
    where the last element is now :math:`> 1`.

    The simple continued fraction representation generated by this function is
    the shorter version, and is thus unique.

def continued_fraction_real(x: int | float | str | Decimal, /) -> Generator[int, None, None]:
    """Generates a finite sequence of elements (coefficients) of a (simple) continued fraction of the given real number.

    The result is a finite sequence even though the given number :math:`x` may
    be irrational or not exactly representable as a real number. 

    The simple continued fraction representation of :math:`x` is a number of
    the form

    .. math::

       a_0 + \\cfrac{1}{a_1 + \\cfrac{1}{a_2 + \\ddots}}

    where :math:`a_0 = [x]` is the integer part of :math:`x`, and the
    :math:`a_1,a_2\\ldots` are the (non-negative) quotients obtained by a
    repeated application of `Euclidean division <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_division>`_
    to the fractional part :math:`x - [x]`, which is called the remainder.

    If the last element :math:`a_n = 1` the sequence can be rewritten as
    :math:`[a_0; a_1, a_2\\ldots, a_{n - 1} + 1]`.

    As Python :py:class:`float` values, like all floating point
    implementations, are `finite precision representations <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html>`_
    of real numbers, the resulting simple continued fraction  of :math:`x`
    generated by this function may be approximate, not exact, and also not
    necessarily unique.

    For non-rational real numbers it is best to pass :py:class:`decimal.Decimal`
    values, with the `context precision <https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/decimal.html#context-objects>`_
    set to the highest level possible.

    The results for rational numbers are guaranteed to be exact however large
    the number, subject to memory and hardware limitations of the running
    environment.

    Invalid values will generate an error in either the
    :py:class:`fractions.Fraction` or :py:class:`decimal.Decimal` classes -
    no errors are raised directly in the function itself.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : int, float, str, decimal.Decimal
        The real number to represent as a simple continued fraction.

    """Generates an (ordered) sequence of all remainders of a (simple) continued fraction from a sequence of its elements in descending order of index.

    If :math:`n` is the order of the continued fraction represented by the

    Parameters
    ----------
    *elements : `int`
        A variable-length sequence of integer elements of a (simple)
        continued fraction.

    Yields
    ------
    fractions.Fraction
        Each element generated is a :py:class:`fractions.Fraction` instance and
        a :math:`k`-th remainder of the given continued fraction.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If no elements are given, or there are any non-integer elements, or
        the tail elements are not positive integers.

    For more information consult the
    `documentation <https://continuedfractions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sources/mediants.html>`_.

    For the left mediant use ``dir="left"``, while for the right use
    ``dir="right"``. The default is ``dir="right"``. For ``k = 1`` the left and
    right mediants are identical to the simple mediant :math:`\\frac{a + c}{b + d}`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    r : `fractions.Fraction`
        The first rational number.

    s : `fractions.Fraction`
        The second rational number.

    dir : `str`, default='right'
        The "direction" of the mediant - `'left'` or `'right'`, as defined
        above.

    k : `int`, default=1
        The order of the mediant, as defined above.

    Returns
    -------
    fractions.Fraction
        The `k`-th left- or right-mediant of the two given rational numbers.
