# Security Policy

Only Python standard libraries are used (see the [project TOML](https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/blob/main/pyproject.toml)) - no 3rd party dependencies are involved.

The repository uses [CodeQL analysis](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning-with-codeql), 
[Dependabot alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts) and [secrets scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning).
