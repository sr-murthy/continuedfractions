Installation
============

A standard :program:`pip` install (with the :code:`-U` "upgrade" option to get the latest version) is sufficient:

.. code:: python

   pip install -U continuedfractions

Only the standard libraries are used. The package is tested and supported on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 & 3.13 (on the latest **Ubuntu Linux**, **MacOS**, and **Windows** versions), although it should be compatible with earlier Python versions as well.
