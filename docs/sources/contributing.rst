Contributing
============

Contributors and contributions are welcome via pull requests from a fork targeting the parent ``main`` `branch <https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/tree/main>`_.

A simple Git workflow, using a feature and/or fix branch created off the ``main`` branch of your fork, is recommended.

.. _contributing.cloning:

Cloning
=======

If you wish to contribute please first ensure you have `SSH access to GitHub <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh>`_. If you do then this should work:

.. code:: bash

   ssh -vT git@github.com

If not please follow the SSH instructions linked above.

Once youâ€™ve forked the repository, it is recommended to clone your fork over SSH:

.. code:: python

   git clone git+ssh://git@github.com/<fork user>/continuedfractions

.. _contributing.dependencies-and-pdm:

Dependencies & PDM
==================

As mentioned earlier, the package has no (production) dependencies, but groups of development requirements are specified in the
``[tool.pdm.dev-dependencies]`` section of the `project TOML <pyproject.toml>`_. Of these only the ``'test'`` dependencies,
including `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.0.x/>`_ and `pytest-cov <https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/>`_, are important.

.. code:: toml

   test = [
       "coverage[toml]",
       "pytest",
       "pytest-cov",
       "pytest-xdist",
   ]

`PDM <https://pdm-project.org/latest>`_ is used (by myself, currently, the sole maintainer) to manage all dependencies and publish packages to PyPI. It is also used to automate certain tasks, such as running tests, as described in the section.

There are no ``requirements*.txt`` files - however, a `PDM lockfile <%60pdm.lock%60>`_ which defines metadata for all TOML-defined
development dependencies, including the currently empty set of production dependencies, and their sub-dependencies etc., can be used to install the project in editable mode.

.. code:: bash

   pdm install -v

For more information on PDM lockfiles and installing requirements see the `PDM documentation <https://pdm-project.org/latest/usage/venv/>`_.

.. _contributing.makefile-and-tests:

Makefile and Tests
==================

The `Makefile <Makefile>`_ defines three main targets: ``lint`` for Ruff linting, ``doctests`` for running
`doctests <https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html>`_ and ``unittests`` for running unittests and measuring coverage, using
``pytest`` and the ``pytest-cov`` plugin:

.. code:: bash

   make lint
   make doctests
   make unittests

Linting warnings should be addressed first. The doctests serve as acceptance tests, and should be run first, before the unit tests.

.. _contributing.documentation:

Documentation
=============

`Project documentation <https://continuedfractions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is defined and built using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_, and deployed to `Read The Docs <https://readthedocs.org>`_. Currently, the building and deployment steps for documentation are not automated in a CI pipeline, but are done manually - this will be addressed in future releases.

.. _contributing.ci-cd:

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
=============================================

The CI/CD pipelines are defined in the `CI YML <.github/workflows/ci.yml>`_, and pipelines for all branches include a tests stage, consisting of Ruff linting, Python doctests, and unit tests, in that order. This will be amended in the future to ensure that tests are only run on updates to PRs targeting ``main``, to avoid duplication on ``main``.

.. _contributing.versioning-and-releases:

Versioning and Releases
=======================

The package is currently at version ``0.11.4`` - `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ is used.

There is currently no dedicated pipeline for releases - both `GitHub releases <https://github.com/sr-murthy/continuedfractions/releases>`_ and `PyPI packages <https://pypi.org/project/continuedfractions>`_ are published manually, but both have the same version tag.

Pipelines for releases (and also documentation) will be added as part of a future release.
