def rationals(
    enumeration: typing.Literal["cantor diagonal", "cantor diagonal transposed", "reverse l", "reverse l transposed"]
) -> typing.Generator[ContinuedFraction, None, None]:
    """:py:class:`typing.Generator` : Generator of all rational numbers :math:`\\mathbb{Q}` using an enumeration on Cantor's 2D representation of the rationals.

    Generates a sequence of all rational numbers as
    :py:class:`~continuedfractions.continuedfractions.ContinuedFraction`
    objects using an enumeration on Cantor's 2D representation of the rationals
    as described in the `documentation <https://continuedfractions.readthedocs.io/sources/sequences.html#rationals>`_.

    The enumeration type should be given by the ``enumeration`` argument, which
    should be one of the following:

    * ``"cantor diagonal"``: for the standard way of enumerating rational
    numbers using Cantor diagonalisation:
    ::

        (1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1) ...

    * ``"cantor diagonal transposed"``: similar to the standard Cantor
    diagonalisation, except the enumeration proceeds:
    ::

        right 1 step ->
        diagonal down 1 step ->
        down 1 step ->
        diagonal up 2 steps ->
        ...
    
    which produces the sequence::

        (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4) ...

    * ``"reverse l"``: an enumeration which proceeds in a reverse L-shaped
    way:
    ::

        down 1 step  ->
        right 1 step -> up 1 step   -> right 1 step ->
        down 2 steps -> left 2 steps -> down 1 step ->
        right 3 steps -> up 3 steps -> right 1 step ->
        down 4 steps  -> left 4 steps -> down 1 step ->
        ...

    which produces the sequence: 
    ::

        (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), ...

    * ``"reverse l transposed"``: enumeration similar to ``"reverse l"``
    except the enumeration proceeds:
    ::

        right 1 step  ->
        down 1 step -> left 1 step   -> down 1 step ->
        right 2 steps -> up 2 steps -> right 1 step ->
        down 3 steps -> left 3 steps -> down 1 step ->
        right 4 steps  -> up 4 steps -> right 1 step ->
        ...
    
    which produces the sequence:
    ::

        (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), ...

    Note that to avoid repetition pairs :math:`(n, n)` where :math:`n > 1` are
    omitted, as are non-coprime pairs :math:`(da, db)` where
    :math:`\\text{gcd}(a, b) = 1` and :math:`d > 1` is a positive integer. The
    condition :math:`\\text{gcd}(a, b) = 1` is necessary and sufficient to
    ensure this.

    Parameters
    ----------
    enumeration : str
        A string literal which describes how the rationals should be
        enumerated:

        * ``"cantor diagonal"``
        * ``"cantor diagonal transposed"``
        * ``"reverse l"``
        * ``"reverse l transposed"``

        These enumerations are described above in the docstring, and also in
        the `Sphinx documentation <https://continuedfractions.readthedocs.io/sources/pythagorean-triples.html#primitive-pythagorean-triples>`_

    Yields
    ------
    ContinuedFraction
        The rational numbers are generated as
        :py:class:`~continuedfractions.continuedfraction.ContinuedFraction`
        objects.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``enumeration`` is not an unrecognised or unsupported enumeration.

        """Backtracks on the KSRM coprime pairs trees from a failed node to the nearest previously visited node that satisfies the node bound.

        A private function that backtracks on the KSRM coprime pairs trees: the
        procedure is that, given a (positive) integer :math:`n > 2`, for which
        coprime pairs are being sought, and a sequence (list) of pairs of
        visited nodes and their associated generating branches in the KSRM
        tree, and assuming that the last element of the visited sequence
        contains the node that "failed", the function identifies the nearest
        previously visited node whose first component satisifes the test
        :math:`< n` **and** and whose associated generating branch is not equal
        to the third branch given by :math:`(x, y) \\longmapsto (x + 2y, y)`.

        .. note::

           The function assumes that the last node in the incoming sequence
           of visited nodes and generating branch pairs represents a "failed"
           node, i.e. whose first component failed the test :math:`\\leq n`
           during the search. No attempt is made to validate or verify the
           failed node, and the only purpose of the function is to backtrack
           to the nearest previously visited node which meets the requirements
           listed above.

        .. note::

           There is no input validation as this is a private function which
           will be called from
           :py:meth:`~continuedfractions.sequences.KSRMTree.search_root`. So
           results for invalid arguments will most likely be incorrect or
           unexpected.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            The (positive) integer :math:`> 2` which is passed by the root
            search method or the general tree search method.

        visited : list
            A sequence of visited nodes and associated generating branches in
            the KSRM coprime pairs tree.

        node_bound : int, default=None
            A bound to check that :math:`a < n` for a node :math:`(a, b)`. The
            actual default value is the incoming :math:`n`, and this is set
            internally.

        Returns
        -------
        tuple
            A tuple consisting of the following values in order: (1) the
            target node in the visited sequence to backtrack to, (2) the
            associated generating branch function (the lambda for branch #1,
            or branch #2, or branch #3), (3) the index of the target node
            and branch pair in the visited sequence, (4) the generating
            branch of the successor node of the target node returned as (1).

        Examples
        --------
        An example where :math:`n = 5` and the failed node is :math:`(6, 1)`,
        which was the successor node to :math:`(4, 1)` from the third branch.

        The given root node need not be the canonical roots, :math:`(2, 1)`,
        :math:`(3, 1)`, but can be any of their successor nodes.

        It is required that :math:`n \\geq 2`, otherwise a
        :py:class:`ValueError` is raised.

        The search implementation is an iterative version of a depth-first
        branch-and-bound search (DFS) procedure, with backtracking and pruning,
        in which nodes are traversed in NLMR pre-order (root -> left -> mid ->
        right) and bounds and checks are applied to the nodes, including
        pruning failed or unnecessary nodes, before further traversal or
        backtracking:
        
        #. Visit the current node :math:`(a, b)` and check :math:`a \\leq n`.
        #. If the check is successful iteratively traverse the current node's
           first child and its children, then the second child and its 
           children, and then the third child and its children, applying the
           check :math:`a \\leq n` to each visited node.
        #. If a check fails for any node backtrack to the nearest previously
           visited node which meets a stricter check :math:`a < n` and which
           has unvisited child nodes, while pruning all visited intermediate
           nodes after the backtracked target node and leading up to the failed
           node, including the failed node. By design the backtracked target
           node will have untraversed children on at least one branch, and the
           traversal can begin again, as described above.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            The positive integer for which coprime pairs :math:`(a, b)`, with
