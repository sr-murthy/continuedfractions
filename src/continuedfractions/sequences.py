class KSRMTree:
    """An implicit/generative tree class implementation of the Kanga-Saunders-Randall-Mitchell (KSRM) disjointed ternary tree for pairs of (positive) coprime integers.

    The term "KSRM tree" is the author's, and refers to a single tree
    that combines the trees presented in the following papers:

    #. A. R. Kanga, *The Family Tree of Pythagorean Triplets*, Bulletin of the Institute of Mathematics and Its Applications **26**, 15 (1990).
    #. R. Saunders and T. Randall, *The Family Tree of the Pythagorean Triplets Revisited*, The Mathematical Gazette **78**, 190 (1994).
    #. D. W. Mitchell, *An Alternative Characterisation of All Primitive Pythagorean Triples*, The Mathematical Gazette **85**, 273 (2001).

    .. note::

       The author could not access the Kanga paper, but the core result is
       described clearly in the papers of Saunders and Randall, and of
       Mitchell.

    The trees presented in these papers are directly related to so-called
    `primitive Pythagorean triples <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple#Elementary_properties_of_primitive_Pythagorean_triples>`_,
    but have a fundamental consequence for the generation of coprime pairs: all
    pairs of (positive) coprime integers :math:`(a, b)`, where
    :math:`1 \\leq b < a`, can be represented as nodes in a disjoint ternary
    tree, with two "parents" (root nodes), :math:`(2, 1)` and :math:`(3, 1)`,
    in which each parent node has exactly three child nodes of the form:

    .. math::

       (a^\\prime, b^\\prime) = \\begin{cases}
                                (2a - b, a), \\hskip{3em} \\text{ branch #} 1 \\\\
                                (2a + b, a), \\hskip{3em} \\text{ branch #} 2 \\\\
                                (a + 2b, b), \\hskip{3em} \\text{ branch #} 3                   
                                \\end{cases}

    where :math:`1 \\leq b < a`, with two pairs of initial values given by
    :math:`(a=2, b=1)`, and :math:`(a=3, b=1)`. Each node in the tree is the
    parent of all nodes that branch from it, but the nodes :math:`(2, 1)` and
    :math:`(3, 1)` are canonical.

    Generating coprime pairs can then be implemented by a generative search
    procedure that starts separately from the parents :math:`(2, 1)` and
    :math:`(3, 1)`, and applies the functions given by the mappings below to
    each parent:

    .. math::

       \\begin{align}
       (a, b) &\\longmapsto (2a - b, a) \\\\
       (a, b) &\\longmapsto (2a + b, a) \\\\
       (a, b) &\\longmapsto (a + 2b, b)
       \\end{align}

    producing the "1st generation" of :math:`3 + 3 = 6` triplets. This can be
    repeated ad infinitum as required.

    .. note::

       The tree starting at the root :math:`(3, 1)` will only contain pairs of
       odd coprimes, under the maps described above.

    If we let :math:`k = 1` denote the 1st generation consisting only of the
    two roots :math:`(2, 1)` and :math:`(3, 1)`, then the :math:`k`-th
    generation for either tree will have a total of :math:`3^{k - 1}`
    children, the total number of all members up to and including the
    :math:`k`-generation will be
    :math:`1 + 3 + 3^2 + \\ldots 3^{k - 1} = \\frac{3^k - 1}{2}`, and the
    total number of all members in both trees up to and including the
    :math:`k`-th generation will be :math:`3^k - 1`.

    The number of coprime pairs generated for a given :math:`n \\geq 1` is
    given by:

    .. math::

       \\phi(1) + \\phi(2) + \\cdots + \\phi(n) = \\sum_{k = 1}^n \\phi(k)

    where :math:`\\phi(k)` is `Euler's totient function <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function>`_.

    This is because if :math:`\\mathcal{C}_n` denotes the set of all coprime
    pairs :math:`(a, b)`, with :math:`1 \\leq b < a \\leq n`, then it can be
    partitioned into disjoint subsets :math:`\\mathcal{C}_k`, where
    :math:`k=1,2,\\ldots,n`, and each :math:`\\mathcal{C}_k` contains
    :math:`\\phi(k)` pairs :math:`(k, j)`, where
    :math:`1 \\leq j < k \\leq n` and :math:`(k, j) = 1`.

           This means in the case of a node failure in the search on the first
           branch, all three branches of the predecessor node of the failed
           node can be pruned in the sequence of visited nodes and generating
           branch pairs.

        .. note::

           The function assumes that the last node in the incoming sequence
           of visited nodes and generating branch pairs represents a "failed"
           node, i.e. whose first component failed the test :math:`\\leq n`
           during the search. No attempt is made to validate or verify the
           failed node, and the only purpose of the function is to backtrack
           to the nearest previously visited node which meets the requirements
           listed above.

        .. note::

           There is no input validation as this is a private function which
           will be called from
           :py:meth:`~continuedfractions.sequences.KSRMTree.search_root`. So
           results for invalid arguments will most likely be incorrect or
           unexpected.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            The (positive) integer :math:`> 2` which is passed by the root
            search method or the general tree search method.

        visited : list
            A sequence of visited nodes and associated generating branches in
            the KSRM coprime pairs tree.

        node_bound : int, default=None
            A bound to check that :math:`a < n` for a node :math:`(a, b)`. The
            actual default value is the incoming :math:`n`, and this is set
            internally.

        Returns
        -------
        tuple
            A tuple consisting of the following values in order: (1) the
            target node in the visited sequence to backtrack to, (2) the
            associated generating branch function (the lambda for branch #1,
            or branch #2, or branch #3), (3) the index of the target node
            and branch pair in the visited sequence, (4) the generating
            branch of the successor node of the target node returned as (1).

        Examples
        --------
        An example where :math:`n = 5` and the failed node is :math:`(6, 1)`,
        which was the successor node to :math:`(4, 1)` from the third branch.

        The given root node need not be the canonical roots, :math:`(2, 1)`,

        It is required that :math:`n \\geq 2`, otherwise a
        :py:class:`ValueError` is raised.

        The search implementation is an iterative version of a backtracking
        depth-first branch-and-bound search (DFS), in which nodes are traversed
        in pre-order, NLMR (root -> left -> mid -> right) and bounds and checks
        are applied to the nodes, before further traversal or backtracking:

        #. If the check is successful iteratively traverse the current node's
           first child and its children, then the second child and its 
           children, and then the third child and its children, applying the
           check :math:`a \\leq n` to each visited node.
        #. If a check fails for any node backtrack to the nearest previously
           visited node which meets a stricter check :math:`a < n` and which
           has unvisited child nodes, while pruning all visited intermediate
           nodes after the backtracked target node and leading up to the failed
           node, including the failed node. By design the backtracked target
           node will have untraversed children on at least one branch, and the
           traversal can begin again, as described above.

        .. note::

           One key property of the KSRM tree used in this implementation is
           that for a given integer :math:`n \\geq 1`, if the current node is
           :math:`(a, b) = (n, b)` and the child node on the first branch,

           so will the child nodes on the second and third branches, and
           thus all three children can be pruned.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            The positive integer for which coprime pairs :math:`(a, b)`, with
            :math:`1 \\leq b < a \\leq n`, are sought.

        root : tuple

    fractions of the form :math:`\\frac{b}{a}` where :math:`(a, b) = 1`.

    As :math:`F_n` also contains the special fraction :math:`\\frac{0}{1}` it
    means that the length :math:`|F_n|` of :math:`F_n` is given by:

    .. math::

       |F_n| = 1 + \\phi(1) + \\phi(2) + \\cdots + \\phi(n) = 1 + \\sum_{k = 1}^n \\phi(k)

    where :math:`\\phi(k)` is `Euler's totient function <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function>`_.

    As :math:`F_n` includes all elements of :math:`F_k` for :math:`k < n` the
    length :math:`|F_n|` can also be written as:

    .. math::

       |F_n| = |F_{n - 1}| + \\phi(n)

    The first five Farey sequences are:

    .. math::

       \\begin{align}
       F_1 &= \\left( \\frac{0}{1}, \\frac{1}{1} \\right) \\\\
       F_2 &= \\left( \\frac{0}{1}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{1} \\right) \\\\
       F_3 &= \\left( \\frac{0}{1}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{1}{1} \\right) \\\\
       F_4 &= \\left( \\frac{0}{1}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{1}{1} \\right) \\\\
       F_5 &= \\left( \\frac{0}{1}, \\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{4}{5}, \\frac{1}{1} \\right)
       \\end{align}

    Farey sequences have quite interesting properties and relations, as
    described `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_sequence>`_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int:
        The order of the Farey sequence.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        A :py:class:`tuple` of ``ContinuedFraction`` instances representing the
        elements of the Farey sequence of order :math:`n`, generated in
        ascending order of magnitude.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> farey_sequence(1)
    (ContinuedFraction(0, 1), ContinuedFraction(1, 1))
    >>> farey_sequence(2)
    (ContinuedFraction(0, 1), ContinuedFraction(1, 2), ContinuedFraction(1, 1))
    >>> farey_sequence(3)
    (ContinuedFraction(0, 1), ContinuedFraction(1, 3), ContinuedFraction(1, 2), ContinuedFraction(2, 3), ContinuedFraction(1, 1))
    >>> farey_sequence(4)
    (ContinuedFraction(0, 1), ContinuedFraction(1, 4), ContinuedFraction(1, 3), ContinuedFraction(1, 2), ContinuedFraction(2, 3), ContinuedFraction(3, 4), ContinuedFraction(1, 1))
    >>> farey_sequence(5)
    (ContinuedFraction(0, 1), ContinuedFraction(1, 5), ContinuedFraction(1, 4), ContinuedFraction(1, 3), ContinuedFraction(2, 5), ContinuedFraction(1, 2), ContinuedFraction(3, 5), ContinuedFraction(2, 3), ContinuedFraction(3, 4), ContinuedFraction(4, 5), ContinuedFraction(1, 1))
